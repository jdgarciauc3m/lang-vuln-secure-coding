\begin{frame}[t]{Rules}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textgood{CON50-CPP}: 
        Do not destroy a mutex while it is locked.
  \vfill
  \item \textgood{CON51-CPP}: 
        Ensure actively held locks are released on exceptional conditions.
  \vfill
  \item \textgood{CON52-CPP}: 
        Prevent data races whe accessing bit fields from multiple threads.
  \vfill
  \item \textgood{CON53-CPP}: 
        Avoid deadlock by locking in a predefined order.
  \vfill
  \item \textgood{CON54-CPP}: 
        Wrap functions that can spuriously wake up in a loop.
  \vfill
  \item \textgood{CON55-CPP}: 
        Preserve thread safety and liveness when using condtion variables.
  \vfill
  \item \textgood{CON56-CPP}: 
        Do not speculatively lock a non-recursive mutex that is already owned by the calling thread.
